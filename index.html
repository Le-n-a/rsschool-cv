  <p>I&#39;m a second-year student at BNTU. Since childhood, I am different mind and ingenuity: the first in school learned to write, read and count. Versatile development: I have musical education and success in sports. I graduated from school with a gold medal and successfully passed the Centralized testing (356 points). I love mathematics, logic problems, all kinds of calculations. I Want to learn and develop in the field of Web development. I believe that this is one of the most interesting areas in the field of it.
    <em><code>To be able to create something new is a unique skill.</code></em>
    <br>And I desperately want to master this skill. I know myself, my skills, ability to learn and most importantly, to achieve what I want. Becoming a successful Web developer is my main goal today. And I will achieve this by any means.</p>
  <h2 id="-skills-and-experience-"><em><code>Skills and Experience</code></em></h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I have no it skills or experience. I read books about WEB development and train on sites for beginners. I took courses at the HTML Academy.</p>

  <p>I&#39;m a BNTU student. Now my first training in the field of development is Rolling Stones School.</p>
  <h2 id="-english-"><em><code>English</code></em></h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I don&#39;t know my English level exactly. I can maintain a conversation on General topics (family, shopping, work, University), talking in simple phrases. I can handle the typical situations on a trip abroad. I can write texts on General topics or familiar to me personally, be able to briefly talk about plans and explain my point of view. My level is somewhere between A2 and B1 I think.</p>
